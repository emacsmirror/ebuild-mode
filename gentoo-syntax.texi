@top gentoo-syntax: An introduction
This collection of modes will help the user to efficiently write and
edit ebuilds, eclasses and eselect modules which are special to Gentoo,
a meta-distribution with various targets (Linux distribution, prefixed
environments in other operating systems, and integration of other
kernels and userlands like the BSDs).

Ebuilds describe the build process and dependencies of a software
package to automatically compile and install it under the control of a
package manager.  They are simple text files, based on Bash shell
scripts and there easy to create.  Eclasses are comparable to a library
which provides generic functions that a set of ebuilds can use by
sourcing it on request.

Eselect is a framework to set one out of many alternatives as the
default value or to activate many out of many choices.  An example is to
choose the version of GNU Emacs called by the @code{/usr/bin/emacs}
program.  Those modules are also near to Bash.

gentoo-syntax provides two modes to edit the above three file types:
Ebuild (Eclass) mode and Eselect mode.  Other features are the execution
of often needed functions (like KEYWORDS manipulation) or fast-track
creation of new ebuilds by skeleton support.

@node Functions
@chapter Available functionality
Two packages are available for installation:
@code{app-emacs/gentoo-syntax} and @code{app-xemacs/gentoo-syntax}
(there is support for GNU Emacs and XEmacs from the same source).  When
installed through the normal package management in Gentoo and proper
configuration of Emacs, gentoo-syntax loads the appropriate mode on
opening files with the extensions @code{.ebuild}, @code{.eclass} and
@code{.eselect}.

If font-locking is enabled, keywords are highlighted, both the standard
set available from vanilla Portage and special functions from all common
eclasses.  Missing highlighting should be reported on
@code{http://bugs.gentoo.org/}.

Generally all functionality is reachable through direct function calls,
keybindings (described later) and menu entries, if the latter is
activated.  So every user has the choice for his/her preferred way of
interfacing with Emacs.

@section Writing a new ebuild

@section Keywording
In ebuild-mode an interface to manipulation of the KEYWORDS variable is
provided in two different ways.

@section Testing and interfacing with Portage

@section Keybindings
@table @kbd
@item C-c C-e
Run the ebuild command, you are prompted for the phase you want.
@item C-c C-a
Create a ChangeLog entry.
@item C-c C-k
Keywording is done via prompts that narrows down your choices which
architectures to mark as testing, dropped among other things.
@item C-c C-y
Generate architecture keywords with the syntax from the ekeyword tool.
@item C-c C-b
Mark all architectures as testing.  Handy for version/revision bumps.
@item C-c C-n
Insert a skeleton ebuild contents, with prompts for desired eclass
inclusions, licenses and USE flags.
